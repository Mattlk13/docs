title: "Testing Go projects"

We scan Go projects by examining your `Gopkg.lock` or `vendor/vendor.json` files to compare the specific versions of every [direct and deep dependency](https://snyk.io/docs/faqs/#about-known-vulnerabilities) in your project against our [Go vulnerability database](/vuln?type=golang).
