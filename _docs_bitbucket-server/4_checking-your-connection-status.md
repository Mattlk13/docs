title: Checking your connection status
---
At any time after you've entered your Bitbucket Server credentials, you can check on the connection status in one of two places.

The first is on your integration settings page, where you'll see your current integrations listed as well as their connection status.

You can also check the status directly on the Bitbucket Server integration settings  page (found by clicking "Edit settings" on the integration settings page shown above). If you've entered credentials, you'll see a box indicating whether or not Snyk is able to correctly connect to Bitbucket Server.

If you are unable to connect, please re-enter your account credentials to verify that they are correct.
