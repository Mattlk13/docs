title: Connecting Snyk to Bitbucket Server
---
In order for Snyk to be able to monitor your Bitbucket Server repos, you'll first need to contact [support@snyk.io](mailto:support@snyk.io) and ask us to enable support on your account. 

Then, you'll be able to connect Snyk to your Bitbucket Server account. You can do this by navigating to the [Integrations page](https://snyk.io/integrations) and clicking on "Connect to Bitbucket Server".

This will take you to a page where you'll be prompted to enter your Bitbucket Server URL, username and password.
