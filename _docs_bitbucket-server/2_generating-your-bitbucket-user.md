title: Generating your Bitbucket Server Credentials
---
To give Snyk access to your Bitbucket Server account, we recommend setting up a dedicated user with read-only permissions.

You can create a user from the admin panel on your bitbucket server.

You can learn more about creating users on the [Bitbucket Server documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/users-and-groups-776640439.html#Usersandgroups-Creatingauser).
