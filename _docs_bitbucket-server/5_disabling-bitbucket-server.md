title: "Disabling the Bitbucket Server Integration"
---
If you decide to disable the Bitbucket Server integration for any reason, you can accomplish this from the "Integration Settings" page in your settings.

You'll need to find the Bitbucket Server integration in your list of integrations, and click "Edit Settings". You'll be taken to a page that shows the current status of your Bitbucket Server connection, a place to update your credentials, and a red box at the bottom to disconnect from Bitbucket Server.

If you choose to disconnect, your Bitbucket Server credentials will be removed from Snyk and any Bitbucket Server projects we had been monitoring will be deactivated on Snyk.

If you choose to re-enable the Bitbucket Server integration at any time, you'll need to re-enter your credentials and activate your projects.
