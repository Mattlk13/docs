Snyk's Pivotal Web Services integration lets you monitor the deployed code of your Java, Node.js and Ruby Pivotal Web Services applications for any known vulnerabilities found in the application's dependencies, testing at a frequency you control.

For each test, Snyk will communicate directly with Pivotal Web Services to determine exactly what code is currently deployed and what dependencies are being used. Each dependency will in turn be tested against Snyk's vulnerability database to see if it contains any known vulnerabilities.

If vulnerabilities are found, you will be alerted (via email or Slack) so that you can take immediate action.

In order to turn on the Pivotal Web Services integration you'll need to:

1. [Connect to Pivotal Web Services](#connecting-snyk-to-pivotal-web-services) from the integrations page
3. [Select the projects you want to monitor](#adding-pivotal-web-services-apps-to-snyk) and click "Add to Snyk"
