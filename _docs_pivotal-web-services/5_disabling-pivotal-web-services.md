title: "Disabling the Pivotal Web Services Integration"
---
If you decide to disable the Pivotal Web Services integration for any reason, you can accomplish this from the "Integration Settings" page in your settings.

You'll need to find the Pivotal Web Services integration in your list of integrations, and click "Edit Settings". You'll be taken to a page that shows the current status of your Pivotal Web Services connection, a place to update your connection details, and a red box at the bottom to disconnect from Pivotal Web Services.

If you choose to disconnect, your Pivotal Web Services credentials will be removed from Snyk and any Pivotal Web Services projects we had been monitoring will be deactivated on Snyk.

If you choose to re-enable the Pivotal Web Services integration at any time, you'll need to re-enter your credentials and activate your projects.
