title: Generating your Heroku API Key
---
You can find and generate your Heroku API key in your "Account Settings" section of your Heroku Account.

Alternatively, you can use the Heroku CLI to generate your API key and copy it directly to your clipboard:

```
heroku auth:token | pbcopy
```

From there you can login to your Snyk account and paste in your Heroku credentials.
