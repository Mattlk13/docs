title: Connecting Snyk to Heroku
---
In order for Snyk to be able to monitor your deployed Heroku applications, you'll first need to connect Snyk to your Heroku account. You can do this by navigating to the [Integrations page](https://snyk.io/integrations) and clicking on "Connect to Heroku".

This will take you to a page where you'll be prompted to enter your Heroku API Key. There is only one API Key per Heroku user so we recommend [setting up a dedicated user for your Snyk organization](#adding-a-snyk-specific-user-to-heroku).

Instructions for how to [generate and locate your Heroku API key](#generating-your-heroku-api-key) are below.
