title: "Disabling the Cloud Foundry Integration"
---
If you decide to disable the Cloud Foundry integration for any reason, you can accomplish this from the "Integration Settings" page in your settings.

You'll need to find the Cloud Foundry integration in your list of integrations, and click "Edit Settings". You'll be taken to a page that shows the current status of your Cloud Foundry connection, a place to update your connection details, and a red box at the bottom to disconnect from Cloud Foundry.

If you choose to disconnect, your Cloud Foundry credentials will be removed from Snyk and any Cloud Foundry projects we had been monitoring will be deactivated on Snyk.

If you choose to re-enable the Cloud Foundry integration at any time, you'll need to re-enter your credentials and activate your projects.
