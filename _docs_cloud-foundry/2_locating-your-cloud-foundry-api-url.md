title: Locating your Cloud Foundry API URL
---
You can find your Cloud Foundry API URL from the [cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) tool.

```
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.example.com (API version: 2.2.0)
```

From there you can login to your Snyk account and enter your Cloud Foundry credentials.
