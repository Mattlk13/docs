title: "What type of Python projects does Snyk support?"
---
Our Snyk CLI tool supports testing and monitoring Python projects that have their dependencies managed by [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and expressed in a `requirements.txt` file.

GitHub integration and support for testing projects with Setup.py files is in the works.
