Snyk can be configured to use custom package registries under specific conditions, allowing insight into dependencies that are not hosted in canonical registries.

The Custom Package Registry feature currently supports Artifactory with Maven and is available on the Pro and Enterprise plans. Maven analysis can be configured to mirror all requests through a custom package repository, or you can specify additional repositories to use alongside Maven Central.

Note: Custom Package Registries do not currently work with brokered SCM integrations. If you currently use a brokered SCM integration or need support for other package managers please email [contact@snyk.io](mailto:contact@snyk.io) and we will send you an announcement as soon as support is available.
