As well as being able to tailor the emails you get about issues, you can also customise the other types of core emails, such as whether you want weekly reports, whether you want to be alerted when you are approaching your test limit (on the free plan), and whether you want to be notified when a test report for a serverless project has been generated and is ready to view.
