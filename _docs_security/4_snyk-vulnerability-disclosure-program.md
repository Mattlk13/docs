title: Snyk's Vulnerability Disclosure Program
---

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Snyk, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Before reporting though, please review this page including our responsible disclosure policy, reward guidelines, and those things that should not be reported.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy
* If you comply with the policies below when reporting a security issue to Snyk, we will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report. We ask that:
a) You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making public any information about the report or sharing such information with others.
b) You do not interact with an individual account (which includes modifying or accessing data from the account) if the account owner has not consented to such actions.
c) You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our services.
d) You do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason. (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempted compromise of sensitive company data or probing for additional issues).
You do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations.


### Terms
* We recognize and reward security researchers who help us keep people safe by reporting vulnerabilities in our services. Make sure to meet the following requirements when submitting a report:
* Adhere to our Responsible Disclosure Policy (see above).
* Report a security bug: that is, identify a vulnerability in our services or infrastructure which creates a security or privacy risk. (Note that Snyk ultimately determines the risk of an issue, and that many software bugs are not security issues).
* We specifically exclude certain types of potential security issues; these are listed under “Ineligible Reports and False Positives” (see below).
* Submit your report to [security@snyk.io](mailto:security@snyk.io) (one issue per report) and respond to the report with any updates. Please do not contact employees directly or through other channels about a report.
* If you inadvertently cause a privacy violation or disruption (such as accessing account data, service configurations, or other confidential information) while investigating an issue, be sure to disclose this in your report.
* Use test accounts and the dedicated bug bounty server (beemo.snyk.io) when investigating issues. 

Note that your use of Snyk services, including for purposes of this program, is subject to Snyk’s Terms and Policies. We may retain any communications about security issues you report for as long as we deem necessary for program purposes, and we may cancel or modify this program at any time.
