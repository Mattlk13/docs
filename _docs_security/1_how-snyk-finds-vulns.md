title: How Snyk finds out about new vulnerabilities
---

We monitor existing security portals and tools, such as:
* [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/)
* [RubySec](http://rubysec.com/)
* [Retire.js](http://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/). 
* Google groups like [nodejs-sec](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec), [ruby-security](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-security-ann) and [RubyonRails-Security](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-security)

We also monitor Github activity and other online sources for new vulnerabilities.
