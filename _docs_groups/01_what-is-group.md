title: Whatâ€™s a Snyk group?
---

Groups is an Enterprise Plan only feature that makes it easier for you to work within teams. Groups can hold many organisations, and each organisation can contain many collaborators.

As well as creating organisations within your enterprise groups, you can also create them within your own personal group. This is ideal if you want to monitor your own personal projects outside of your enterprise's group, or if you want a sandbox to play with.
