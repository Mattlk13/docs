title: Whatâ€™s a Snyk group?
---

Groups are an Enterprise Plan only feature that makes it easier for you to work within teams. Groups can hold many organisations, and organisations can contain many collaborators.

As well as creating organisations within your groups, you can also create them within your own personal group. This is ideal for if you want to monitor your own personal projects outside of your enterprise's group, or you want a sandbox to play with.
