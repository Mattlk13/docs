title: Group overview
---

The group overview area allows you to view reports across all of your group's organisations, and configure your group settings.

### Reports

From the group overview, the vulnerability status of all of a group's organisations are visible in one place. You can select which organisations you wish to compare via the filter dropdown. This will set the context for all the tabs within the reports, where you can continue to filter other values such as type, status and package manager.

#### Quick Filters

If there's a view you refer to frequently, you can save this as a Quick Filter.

### Settings

Within the group overview, you can also view all of a group's members. Note that these aren't members of your organisations (who are managed within the organisation's settings area), but are members who can access all organisations within that group.
