Our Jira integration allows you to raise issues for vulnerabilities or license issues in Snyk. Itâ€™s available to all our Pro and Enterprise customers. Our integration includes an API ([see our API docs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/project-jira-issues)), and a way to manually raise a Jira issue in the UI (documented here).
