title: "Creating a license policy"
---

Snyk lets you create a custom license policy for each organisation. If you have the license feature available for your organisation, you can access the policy in your organisation's settings area.

For each license, you can select which license types you'd like to trigger a violation, and the severity you'd like to set it to.

When Snyk detects a license violation, it will display it in your project in the same way as a security vulnerability.
