As well as monitoring your vulnerability status, Snyk can help you with your license compliance if you are on any paid plan (Standard, Pro or Enterprise) by reporting on the licenses used by your dependencies. License data is inferred from the package's manifest file, pulled from the central repository, which we then compare against [SPDX](https://spdx.org/)'s license standards.
