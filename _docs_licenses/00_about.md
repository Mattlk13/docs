As well as monitoring your vulnerability status, if you're an Enterprise Plan customer, Snyk helps you stay compliant by reporting on the licenses used by your dependencies. License data is inferred from the package's manifest file, pulled from the central repository, which we then compare against [SPDX](https://spdx.org/)'s license standards.
