Snyk Runtime Protection extends the Snyk offering to your application's production environment. A Snyk agent is used to instrument your application with a minimal impact footprint, tracking the use of dependencies by your application. The agent tracks invocations of vulnerable functions in your dependencies, reporting back to Snyk.io.

Snyk Runtime Protection allows you to understand which vulnerable dependencies are more at risk of being exploited, focusing your remediation efforts where they matter the most.
