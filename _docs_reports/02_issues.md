The Issues tab shows an inventory of all issues in your projects. These are grouped by issue, but you can select "view issues ungrouped" to switch the view to showing each issue and project on their own row.

From here, you can click on the "projects" link to view a list of all the projects that vulnerability affects. You can also filter by severity, issue type (whether it's a license issue or vulnerability), language, status (open, fixed, patched or ignored), and whether it's fixable via a patch or upgrade.
