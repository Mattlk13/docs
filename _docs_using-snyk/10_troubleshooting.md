title: Troubleshooting

If your instance of the Snyk CLI has started failing, follow these steps to resolve:

1. Ensure you are on the most up to date version of the CLI by running

	 ```console
   npm update -g snyk
   ``` 
2. Make sure you are authenticating prior to running the Snyk CLI command

  You can either authenticate by running snyk auth in your terminal, and itâ€™ll guide you through this process, or visit https://snyk.io/account copy your API token and paste it into your terminal as follows:
  ```console
   snyk auth <your token>
   ``` 

3. If you are still having problems after upgrading and authenticating send an email to support@snyk.io and we will try to help you out. 

###Note:
Authentication is required for snyk test and snyk monitor from Tuesday the 24th of January 2017 for details on why we require authentication take a look at https://snyk.io/blog/requiring-authentication/  

Registration with Snyk is free. If you do not already have an account all you need to do is run `snyk auth` in your terminal (or register on https://snyk.io/) to get an account setup.
