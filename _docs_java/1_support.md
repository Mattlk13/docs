Snyk for Java supports testing Java projects that have their dependencies managed by [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
Maven support is available for [GitHub repositories](/docs/github), and via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/), while Gradle support is available via the Snyk CLI only.
