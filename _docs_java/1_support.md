title: "What type of Java projects does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk for Java supports testing Java projects that have their dependencies managed by [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
It is available for [GitHub repositories](/docs/github), and via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/).

Alternatively, if you use Gradle, there is a [workaround you can use](/docs/snyk-for-java#using-snyk-with-gradle-managed-projects) to enable Snyk to monitor your dependencies.
