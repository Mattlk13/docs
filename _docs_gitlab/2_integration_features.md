Watch a Node.js, Ruby, Python, Scala or Java GitLab project to add it as a project to Snyk. This will allow you to:

* see Snyk tests in your merge requests that check for vulnerabilities.
* get email alerts and a Snyk merge request with fixes when new vulnerabilities that affect your project are disclosed.
* get email alerts and a Snyk merge request if a new upgrade or patch is available for a vulnerability that affects you.
* trigger a Snyk merge request with fixes yourself from the test report page or the project page for your project on snyk.io.
