title: How to integrate GitLab to test and watch your projects
---

You can add your Node.js, Ruby, Python, Scala and Java GitLab projects and quickly test them, or decide which ones youâ€™d like to continuously watch with Snyk.

**This integration only works with GitLab instances that are publicly reachable (not on a private network). For private instances, you will need to set up via [Snyk's Broker](https://snyk.io/docs/snyk-broker#gitlab-setup) first.**

1. Generate a Personal Access Token in your GitLab. You'll find this option in your user account settings area, in the "Access Tokens" section.
2. Go to Snyk's [integrations](https://snyk.io/integrations) page and click "Connect to GitLab".
3. Add your account credentials and the token you just generated to the GitLab integration settings area in Snyk.
