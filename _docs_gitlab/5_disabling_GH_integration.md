title: Disabling the GitLab integration
---

If you don’t want to watch a GitLab project anymore, you can stop watching this project via the project settings. The project will be set to inactive, and you’ll no longer get alerts, merge requests, or Snyk test on your merge requests. The webhook that enables the GitLab integration for this project will be removed.

You can restart watching at any time.
