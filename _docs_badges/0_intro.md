Once youâ€™re vulnerability free, you can put a badge on your README showing your package has no known security holes. This will show your users you care about security, and tell them that they should care too.

If there are no vulnerabilities, this is indicated by a green badge.

If vulnerabilities have been found, the red badge will show the number of vulnerabilities.
