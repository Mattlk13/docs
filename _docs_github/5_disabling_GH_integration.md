title: Disabling the GitHub integration
---

If you don’t want to watch a GitHub repo anymore, you can stop watching this project via the project settings. The project will be set to inactive, and you’ll no longer get alerts, pull requests, or Snyk test on your pull requests. The webhook that enables the GitHub integration for this repo will be removed.

You can restart watching at any time.
