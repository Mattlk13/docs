Watch a Node.js or Ruby GitHub repo to add it as a project to Snyk. This will allow you to:

* see Snyk tests in your pull request that check for vulnerabilities
* get email alerts and a Snyk pull request with fixes when new vulnerabilities that affect your repo are disclosed
* get email alerts and a Snyk pull request if a new upgrade or patch is available for a vulnerability that affects you
* trigger a Snyk pull request with fixes yourself from the test report page or the project page for your repo on snyk.io
