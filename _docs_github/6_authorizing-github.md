To view your organisation's GitHub projects on Snyk, you will need to have sufficient user permissions. When you authenticate Snyk, GitHub will show you which organisations you can integrate.

If you do not have the correct permissions, you will see "Access request pending" next to your ogranisation's name, and you will be unable to see this organisation's projects in Snyk.

If you'd like to integrate this organisation, you will need to [request organisational approval](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-your-authorized-applications/) in GitHub.
