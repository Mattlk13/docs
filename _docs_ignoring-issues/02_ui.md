title: "Ignoring issues in the UI"
---

Each issue card has an ignore button that opens up a dialog where you can select _why_ you want to ignore the issue, as well as how long you want to ignore it for.

Checking "Ignore this issue until fix is available" (which is checked by default if there is currently no remediation) will resurface the vulnerability as soon as we have a fix for it, and you can optionally give additional details on why you're ignoring the issue.

Note: an issue is ignored until ANY of the conditions happen - either the ignore period expires, OR the vuln becomes fixable

When you ignore an issue in our UI, it will show who ignored it, and allow you to edit or unignore it.

### Additional ignore settings

Since suppressing vulnerabilities carries a level of risk, there is a setting which allows you to decide whether this feature is available to admins only. To set this, go to your organisation settings, and select "Admin only" in the "Ignores" section. When you enable "Admin only" for ignores, this will also disable ignores from being added via the CLI because we are unable to prevent non-admins from ignoring issues in this environment.

You can also choose to set the "more details" field to be a compulsory field when an issue is being ignored, requiring the user to enter a reason for each ignore.

### Ignores in reports

If you have access to our Reports feature, you will also be able to see an overview of how many issues in your organisation's projects are ignored, along with an option to filter these so you can drill down into each one. If the issue was ignored in our UI, we include a credit for additional accountability, so you can see who initiated it.
