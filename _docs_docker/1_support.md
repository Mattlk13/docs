title: "What type of Docker images does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk supports testing and monitoring Docker images that have their dependencies managed by [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt), [RPM](http://rpm.org/) or [APK](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages). Docker scanning is available via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/).

Docker scanning is available as an add on to our paid plans. See [Plans](/plans) to learn more.
