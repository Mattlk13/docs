title: "What type of Docker images does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk supports testing and monitoring Docker images that have their dependencies managed by [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt), [RPM](http://rpm.org/) or [APK](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages). Docker scanning is available via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/).

Docker scanning is available to our Enterprise customers. See [Plans](https://snyk.io/plans) to learn more.
