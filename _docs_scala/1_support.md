title: "What type of Scala projects does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk supports testing and fixing Scala projects that have their dependencies managed by [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). Support is available for [GitHub](/docs/github), [Bitbucket Servert](/docs/bitbucket-server), [GitLab](/docs/gitlab) repositories, and via the Snyk [CLI](/docs/using-snyk/).

**Note: To use the Snyk CLI, you will need to first install the [sbt-dependency-graph plugin](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph).**
