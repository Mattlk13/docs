The Broker client is a web server which securely relays requests between Snyk's servers and your repositories hosted on supported SCMs. It needs to run on a network which has both outbound internet access and access to your SCM.

The Broker client is best installed as a docker image. See the [Dockerhub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/broker/) for further details on installing and configuring your Broker client.

The Broker is an open source project hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/broker).
