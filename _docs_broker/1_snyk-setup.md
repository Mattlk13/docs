In order to use Snyk with your SCM, Snyk will first need to enable broker support for one of your Snyk organisations.

To request broker support, contact [support@snyk.io](mailto:support@snyk.io) with the name of the organisation that you'd like to connect to your SCM.

Each broker is identified by a UUID token. Once broker support has been enabled for your organisation, you can access your unique broker token on the organisation's settings page. This token is private, and must not be shared.
