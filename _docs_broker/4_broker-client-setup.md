The broker client is a web server which securely relays requests between Snyk's servers and your GitHub Enterprise. It needs to run on a network which has both outbound internet access and access to your GitHub Enterprise.

The broker client is best installed as a docker image. See the [Dockerhub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/broker/) for further details on installing and configuring your broker client.
