An organisation can have multiple administrators. When you create an organisation, you will automatically be an administrator on this organisation. If you want to downgrade to collaborator, or leave this organisation, the organisation has to have at least one other administrator.

Note: you will always be the administrator of your default organisation, and you can’t leave or delete this organisation.
