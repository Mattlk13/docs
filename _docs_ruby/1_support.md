title: "What type of Ruby projects do we support?"

Ruby V1 supports scanning and fixing Ruby projects that have their dependencies managed by Bundler. Youâ€™ll also need to have your Gemfile.lock checked into the root of your repository. 
Support for gem libraries is in the pipeline. 
Snyk for Ruby is currently only available for GitHub repositories.
