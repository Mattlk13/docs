title: "What type of Ruby projects does Snyk support?"
---
Snyk supports testing and fixing Ruby projects that have their dependencies managed by [Bundler](https://bundler.io/). For GitHub support you need to have your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock checked into the root of your repository. Our CLI tool also supports Ruby, and you can test and monitor your apps continuously with our CI integration. Support for gem libraries is in the pipeline.

If your Gemfile needs access to private Gem sources please [get in touch](mailto:support@snyk.io).
