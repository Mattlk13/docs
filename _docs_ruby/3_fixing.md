title: "Fixing Ruby projects"
---

Currently we only support fixing Ruby projects through our GitHub integration. We fix by updating vulnerable gems, using `bundle update`, after modifying your Gemfile (sticking to the rules you have specified there as far as possible). This means that in some scenarios we wonâ€™t be able to upgrade all dependencies to non-vulnerable versions. In this case, you should consider updating the rules in your Gemfile. In future releases, we are planning to provide suggestions to make this easier.
