Snyk continuously finds and fixes vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

## Snyk for Node.js

If you want to secure Node.js projects, we recommend to get started with our [GitHub integration](https://snyk.io/docs/github/).
Alternatively, use our [CLI tool](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/). Our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci#node-js-ci-integration) is easy to set up and works with Travis, Circle, Codeship and other tools.

You can also monitor the deployed code in your [AWS Lambda functions](https://snyk.io/docs/aws-lambda) or [Heroku applications](https://snyk.io/docs/heroku) using Snyk's serverless monitoring.

If you're using Bitbucket, sign up and try our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci/), and check our setup instructions for [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://snyk.io/docs/bitbucket/).

## Snyk for Ruby

Find and fix your Ruby projects that have their dependencies managed by Bundler with our [GitHub integration](https://snyk.io/docs/github/).

You can also monitor the deployed code in your [AWS Lambda functions](https://snyk.io/docs/aws-lambda) or [Heroku applications](https://snyk.io/docs/heroku) using Snyk's serverless monitoring.

Our [CLI tool](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/) also supports Ruby, and you can test and monitor your apps continuously with our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci#ruby-or-java-ci-integration).

You’ll need to have your Gemfile.lock checked into the root of your repository. Support for gem libraries is in the pipeline.

## Snyk for Java

Protect your Java projects that have their dependencies managed by Maven (a workaround does exist [for Gradle projects](/docs/snyk-for-java#using-snyk-with-gradle-managed-projects) as well) with our [GitHub integration](https://snyk.io/docs/github/).

Our [CLI tool](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/) also supports Java, and you can test and monitor your apps continuously with our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci#ruby-or-java-ci-integration).

You’ll need to have your pom.xml checked into the root of your repository.

## Snyk for GitHub Enterprise

Snyk can be used with private GitHub Enterprise installations via a custom proxy, referred to as the Snyk “broker”. A Snyk broker can also be used between Snyk and github.com itself, to reduce Snyk’s access to your GitHub repositories.

Check our [GitHub Enterprise documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/snyk-broker/). If you're interested in using it, [get in touch](mailto:support@snyk.io).
