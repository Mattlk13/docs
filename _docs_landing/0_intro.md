Snyk continuously finds and fixes vulnerabilities in your dependencies. 

## Snyk for Node.js

If you want to secure Node.js projects, we recommend to get started with our [GitHub integration](https://snyk.io/docs/github/). 
Alternatively, use our [CLI tool](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/). Our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci#node-js-ci-integration) is easy to set up and works with Travis, Circle, Codeship and other tools. 

If you're using Bitbucket, sign up and try our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci/), and check our setup instrutions for [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://snyk.io/docs/bitbucket/).

## Snyk for Ruby

Find and fix your Ruby projects that have their dependencies managed by Bundler with our [GitHub integration](https://snyk.io/docs/github/). 
Our [CLI tool](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/) also supports Ruby, and you can test and monitor your apps continuously with our [CI integration](https://snyk.io/docs/ci#ruby-ci-integration).

You’ll need to have your Gemfile.lock checked into the root of your repository. Support for gem libraries is in the pipeline.

## Snyk for GitHub Enterprise

Snyk can be used with private GitHub Enterprise installations via a custom proxy, referred to as the Snyk “broker”. A Snyk broker can also be used between Snyk and github.com itself, to reduce Snyk’s access to your GitHub repositories. 

Check our [GitHub Enterprise documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/snyk-broker/). If you're interested in using it, [get in touch](mailto:support@snyk.io).
