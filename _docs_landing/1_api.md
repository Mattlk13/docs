Looking to build something bespoke? You can use our API to access information about issues affecting your projects. We've written a blog post which [introduces working with the API](https://snyk.io/blog/using-the-snyk-api-to-get-your-vulnerabilities/).

Read the complete [API Documentation](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io).

Let us know if you've got any questions or suggestions. We'd love to hear how you're using the API.
